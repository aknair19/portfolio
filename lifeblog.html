        <p> Web development was something which i never thought of doing.
            I belong from a commerce background and so its general and obvious that there is a perception coding is
            meant for one who is familiar which standard languages which is being used for years.
            In present world when we notice startups that is using advance marketing strategies for wider reach and the
            creative team build by them is commendable. For instance if you have watch an advertisement of cred we see
            its very representation which attracts us to consume there services. So one day i downloaded this app and
            the User Interface felt very intresting to me.
        </p>

        <p>I Started by leaning HTML,CSS made a couple of web pages. After a having a good grip on HTML and CSS i
            started learning Javascript which i felt fairly tough at first. Then onwards i started creating simple
            application/games. It took a hell lot of a time for me to make each of them, it was getting frustrating at
            times but when the final product gets ready it feels total worth it. Thats when i realized i love creating
            and designing stuff, making things work is what i love to do. To improve my logical thinking i started doing
            problem solving exercises. Ofcouse none of them were easy, I've beaten my head over many times if i cant get
            it right, I've cried if anything doesnt seem to work, I've dropped many projects if i didnt know what should
            i use to work it out or i was too lazy complete it. I still do all of these things but one thing i've
            realized is i love failing and keep trying in this arena. I still have long long way to go and one day i
            want to be recognised as well established web developer.

            <strong> Here are some of my observations/learnings I've picked up on my journey so far..
                Just a disclaimer this may not apply to you because am still a beginner in this field.
            </strong>
        <ol>

            <li> You will have to give yourself some hard time.Its definitly not easy but its fun.</li>
            <li>If you dont know something, Google got your answers.</li>
            <li> Try to learn things you dont know in-depth. Dont just learn the top layer, dig a little deeper.</li>
            <li> Be Clam and Have patience. In stress you sometimes overlook the picture and miss the silly mistake you
                might have made.
            </li>

            <li> You wont learn by watching, you learn by actually coding.</li>
            <li> Whenever you are not coding do something fun and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Join communities with people better tham you, ask help and doubts if feel stuck.</li>
            <li> 1 hour daily practice is better than 5 hours in every 3 three days </li>
            <li> Dont be insecure if someone is better, be inspired.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>Coding is something which facinates me and even as a beginner I strongly feels how it changes our perception of thinking and find ways of doing things in different ways even in real world.
