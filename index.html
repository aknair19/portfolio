        <p class="size">Hola! My name is Abhishek Nair. I am a B.com graduate from Delhi University and currently working as a market researcher in a pvt.ltd. company.  After my job i used to spend hours doing research on its scope and how  i can make a career transition and that's how I developed an interest in the field of programming get started by  creating some simple web pages. Slowly steadily i tried to create simple yet fun games, and thats how i realized i love to code and make things. I still have a long way to go and one day i wish to be recoginised as a well established web developer. Above all I am also a decent Tablist ("Tabla is percussion instrument used in Hindustani and Carnatic music") and do stage performances in poojas. I also love watching & playing football.</p>
