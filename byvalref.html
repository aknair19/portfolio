    <h1>By Value VS By Reference</h1>

<section>
    <p>Today am going to talk about and explain how by value and by reference works in Javascript as far as i
        understand.
        This is one of the fundamental concepts of Javascript. Understanding this is very important and it will also
        help
        you to
        debug your code better. First we will talk about primitive value and then we move on to objects. For
        those of you who are not familiar-- Numbers, Strings, Boolean etc. are primitive and besides that almost
        everything in
        javascript is an
        object.
        Now Lets start!
    </p>

    <p><strong>By Value :</strong></p>
    <div class="code-container">
        let a = 10;<br>
        let b = a; <br>
    </div>

    <p>In the above code snippet both variables 'a' and 'b' will have value 10, which i dont think you had hard time
        figuring out but its important
        to understand how that happens.</p>

    

    <p> When 'a' is declared a spot in the memmory is made for 'a' which means 'a' now
        has
        address
        location
        where it knows, where it sits in the memmory. When 'b' is declared and 'a' assigned to it 'b' points to a new
        location in the
        memmory and a copied value of 'a' is assigned to 'b' . Now both 'a' and 'b' points to same value with both
        having different
        location in the memmory, this approach is known as By value.
    </p>

    <div class="code-container">
        let a = 10;<br>
        let b = a; <br>

        a = 11;
    </div>

    <p>now even if we change value of 'a' , the value of 'b' doesnt change because both have different memmory
        location. So 'b' will
        still remain 10 and 'a' will be 11</p>

    <p><strong>By Reference :</strong></p>

    <div class="code-container">
        let a = {&nbsp; name: &nbsp;'Gokul' &nbsp;};<br>
        let b = a; <br>
    </div>
    <p>In the above code snippet
        when a was set equal to an object and will get a new spot in memmory or address location in the memmory of your
        computer
        But when 'b' is set equal to 'a' , instead of getting a new spot in memmory it points to same addresss location
        where 'a'
        sits.
    </p>
  
    <p>Now both 'a' and 'b' have same values beacause they both points to same exact location in the memmory. This
        approach
        is known as By reference. No copied value of 'a' is created in this case.
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
        let a = {&nbsp; name: &nbsp;'Gokul' &nbsp;};<br>
        let b = a; <br>

        a.name = 'Rahul';
    </div>

    <p>Now if we make changes in property of 'a' and beacause both of the variables points to exact same location ,those
        changes
        will reflect in
        'b' too. A change in one variable will cause change in other variables if they are set equal to each other in
        case of objects,
        as objects use by reference approach.
    </p>

    <p><strong>An exception</strong></p>

    <div class="code-container">
        let a = {&nbsp; name: &nbsp;'Tanay' &nbsp;};<br>
    </div>

    <p>In this case a new address location will be created for 'a' as it was not pre-existing in memmory.
        Earlier when we did 'b = a' "a" was already in the memmory that is why new address location was not created for
        'b'.
        So thats only exception where By Reference doesn't really applies.
    </p>

    <p>Ok so that was my Understanding of this concept, I am still learning and please feel free to
        contact me if any correction
        has to be made or something else is to be added. Thank you for reading.. Keep Coding! Keep Learning!
